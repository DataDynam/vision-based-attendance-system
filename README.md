## Overview:
An attendance system that leverages computer vision to track the presence and activities of employees in a workspace. The system uses real-time face detection and recognition on video camera streams and has features like addition of new employees and an associated web application for showing attendance records.
## Architecture:
The system architecture involves multiple input data sources mainly live streams (Videos) from environment cameras, processing unit, storage unit and an output- a reliable employees attendance/activity database on a web application.
## Modules:
The project has four main modules, Data Acquisition, Computer Vision processing, Attendance logic and a web application. Each goes through detailed steps to achieve the system's goals.

For more details on each module and the system architecture, check the complete README content in the repository.
